# Welcome to bloccit!
bloccit is a Reddit-like app that I created using Ruby on Rails, HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript while completing the Web Developer Track at bloc.io. You can sign up, sign in & sign out; and create, view, edit & delete topics, posts & comments, as well as vote on posts. Test/dev db's are Sqlite3, production db is PostgreSQL. Bootstrap was used for the styling, and Faker for (most of) the pre-seeded data. Please note that because of a current discrepancy between test/dev & production environments, Topics are not able to be deleted at this time (deeper db work needed). A solution is being worked on & this readme will be updated when one is found.

## To Use The App
- Go to https://ag17-bloccit.herokuapp.com/
- Sign in using the email admin@test.test & password wsxedc
- Have fun & poke around! Try creating your own topic, or commenting on a post!
